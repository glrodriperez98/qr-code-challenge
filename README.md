## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first design principles
- Google Fonts (Outfit)

### What I Learned

This challenge helped reinforce the importance of:

- Using the `meta viewport` tag for proper mobile scaling
- Structuring components with Flexbox for responsiveness
- Utilizing relative units like `max-width` and `auto` height for adaptable layouts

Here’s a snippet I’m proud of:

```
css
.qr-code img {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 250px;
  height: auto;
  border-radius: 10px;
}
```
This allowed the image to scale nicely on both desktop and mobile while maintaining a clean rounded border.

### Continued Development
I’d like to further improve:

My understanding of accessibility and alt text usage

More advanced responsive design techniques using media queries

Building components with more reusable CSS
